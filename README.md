# VoiceAssistant
This is a simple voice assistant script written in Python. It uses the following modules: speech_recognition, playsound, gtts, os, wolframalpha, selenium, and Keys.

The script allows the user to speak to the assistant and receive a response. The assistant can perform a few actions such as searching the web and playing a video on YouTube. The assistant can also perform calculations using the Wolfram Alpha API.

To use the script, run it in a Python interpreter and follow the prompts. The assistant will listen for your input and respond accordingly.
